# myfirst-eln

Welcome to myfirst-eln — a lightweight, generic Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) designed to organize experiments, notes, and files in a reproducible, searchable way.

Overview
-
This repository contains a starting template for an ELN-style application inspired by modern ELN platforms. It focuses on core workflows you would expect from an ELN:

- Create and manage experiments, protocols, and notebooks
- Attach files, images, and datasets to entries
- Tagging, searching, and organizing records
- Templates for common experiment types
- User and team collaboration workflows

Getting Started
-
1. Clone the repo (if you haven't already):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tyoung-4/myfirst-eln.git
cd myfirst-eln
```

2. This project is a scaffold. Depending on your tech stack, create an environment and install dependencies. Example (Node.js):

```bash
# install dependencies (example)
npm install
npm run dev
```

Usage (high level)
-
- New record: Create an experiment or notebook entry with a title, date, metadata (project, tags, authors), and a rich-text or markdown body.
- Attachments: Upload files, images, or data files and link them to entries.
- Templates: Use or create templates for recurring experiment types to keep records consistent.
- Search & filters: Search by title, tag, date range, or full-text within entries.
- Export: Export individual entries or whole projects as PDF/Markdown for sharing or backup.

Design notes & inspiration
-
This project is intended as a flexible, extendable foundation; the final product may include features similar to commercial ELNs such as experiment timelines, inventory integration, and reporting. The video demonstration at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpDAIxncgh0 provides a reference-style user experience (not copied here) to inform feature and UX decisions.
